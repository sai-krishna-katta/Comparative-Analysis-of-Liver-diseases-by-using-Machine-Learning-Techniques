# Comparative-Analysis-of-Liver-diseases-by-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques


 Many persons are suffering from liver disease, but they don’t know it.The identification of liver diseases in the early stage
helps a patient get better treatment.
· If it is not diagnosed earlier, it may lead to various health issues. To solve these issues, physicians need to examine
whether the patient has been affected by liver disease or not, based on the multiple parameters.
· In this project, we classify the patients who have liver disease or not by using different machine learning algorithms by
comparing the performance factors and predicting the better result. The liver dataset is retrieved from the Kaggle dataset.
